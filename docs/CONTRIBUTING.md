# About contributing to Easy MQTT Handler

Everyone is welcome to contribute to Easy MQTT Handler. However, as usual in life, there are a few rules in place to keep
everybody happy:

1. If you contribute to Easy MQTT Handler you need to accept that fact that you are doing so under the terms and conditions
of the GPLv3+ license. You can find out what the means by reading the [LICENSE](../LICENSE) file in the repos root directory.

2. The maintainer reserves the right to refuse contributions for whatever reason.

3. This a _free-time project_. This means that support and pull requests reviews might need some time. 
I might even forget about owning this repo one day and vanish for expected or unexpected reasons.

4. I owe nothing to anybody.

5. If I decide one day to take this project to another level and invest more than I'm planning at the moment, I might 
take donations at one point. If I do so you agree that even if you are a contributor are not receiving a single cent.
I might share something with you, if you are a sort of main-contributor to this project, but I will decide so on my
own discretion. Especially take note of rule number 4 again in this case.

6. Please only take part in this project if you understand the rules of civil discourse. I'm not feeling like
publishing a Code of Conduct at this point, but I expect everyone participating in this project to behave like a 
human-being should. This especially means: No racism, no sexism, no discrimination, no stalking, no doxxing, 
no harassment. Please be kind and decent humans. If you are I'm more than welcoming everybody to participate in 
this project and eventually make something even greater out of it.

7. I might one day publish this tool on the Windows and / or Apple Store. This versions will not be available for free, 
as they will cause me some costs (mainly registration fees for developer accounts and code signing certificates).
They will be offered for convenience reasons. Besides that I'm planing to always keep this free and open source for
everybody to use. The commercial version will not be different from the free version, except for the fact that users can
install them via their store frontends. You agree that part of those offerings will be the code you contributed. The users 
will not be charged for the tool, but for the additional effort I have in offering them on the stores. I will not
distribute any sort of income amongst the contributors.

At the moment there are no coding guidelines. I'm using Jetbrains PyCharm with default settings to develop this.
It should stick to the common Python coding guidelines, I guess. If you are contributing code, please make sure that
it doesn't break cross-platform compatibility. This project should always at least support Linux, Windows and MacOS.

If you cannot contribute code, because you are no developer, you might be able to help with translating the tool and
making it available to a broader audience, maybe. Please check out the document [I18N.md](I18N.md) to read about how you can
contribute a new language. In general please take a look at [REPO-STRUCTURE.md](REPO-STRUCTURE.md) to understand the
way this tool's repository is structured. Staying inside the given structure should make it easier for new contributors
to contribute.

To get you started with building the tool, please take a look at [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md).
In case you want to package this tool on your own feel free to consult the file [PACKAGING.md](PACKAGING.md).

There's btw a list of open TODOs. You can find it in [TODOS.md](TODOS.md). 
I'm sure there's definitely more to do than I have documented for the moment, but it should be a good starting point if
you are missing something. You can of course also send pull requests to the [TODOS.md](TODOS.md) file or just open an issue 
via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/andzeil/easy-mqtt-handler/issues).
